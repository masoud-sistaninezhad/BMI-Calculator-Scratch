# BMI Calculator (Scratch Project)

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Scratch.  
The project asks the user to enter their **weight (in kg)** and **height (in cm)**, then calculates the BMI and displays a health message based on the result.

## How It Works

1. The user enters their weight and height.
2. The program calculates BMI using the formula:  
   `BMI = weight / (height in meters)^2`
3. It displays the calculated BMI and a category:
   - Underweight
   - Normal weight
   - Overweight
   - Obese

## File
